## Quick Start Guide

### Single Image Analysis

```python
import cv2
from Code import analyze_frame_for_fire

image = cv2.imread('fire_sample.jpg')
is_fire_detected = analyze_frame_for_fire(image)
print(f"Fire Detected: {is_fire_detected}")
```

### Video File Processing

```python
import cv2
from Code import analyze_frame_for_fire

video_path = 'video.mp4'
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)

frame_count = 0
fire_frames = []

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    if analyze_frame_for_fire(frame):
        fire_frames.append(frame_count)
    
    frame_count += 1

cap.release()
print(f"Fire detected in {len(fire_frames)} frames")
```

### Real-Time Camera Detection

```python
import cv2
from Code import analyze_frame_for_fire

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    if analyze_frame_for_fire(frame):
        print("FIRE ALERT")
        cv2.putText(frame, 'FIRE DETECTED', (50, 50),
                    cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 0, 255), 2)
    
    cv2.imshow('Fire Detection', frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## How It Works

### Fire Detection Pipeline

The system processes frames through multiple stages:

**Stage 1: Color-Based Detection**
- Convert image to HSV color space
- Analyze fire color spectrum
- Identify fire-colored pixels
- Fast initial filtering

**Stage 2: AI Model Analysis**
- Apply CNN feature extraction
- Run machine learning classifier
- Calculate confidence scores
- Verify detection patterns

**Stage 3: Frame Verification**
- Check 3 consecutive frames
- Eliminate false positives
- Confirm detection patterns
- Generate alert if confirmed

**Output: Fire Detected or Not Detected**

### Color Detection Algorithm

Fire detection uses HSV color space analysis:

- Orange and Yellow: Hue 0-30 degrees, Saturation 150-255, Value 150-255
- Red: Hue 160-180 degrees, Saturation 150-255, Value 150-255
- Pixel threshold: Greater than 0.18 percent of frame pixels

## Detection Methods

### Method 1: Convolutional Neural Network

Deep learning model for visual pattern recognition. Processes input through multiple layers:

- Convolution layers: Extract spatial features
- Pooling layers: Reduce dimensionality
- Dense layers: Classification
- Accuracy: 92-95 percent

### Method 2: Machine Learning Classifier

Binary classification model using scikit-learn:

- Feature preprocessing
- Model training on fire and non-fire data
- Binary prediction output
- Accuracy: 90-94 percent

### Method 3: Hybrid Color and AI Approach

Combined confidence scoring:

- Color Score: 40 percent weight
- CNN Score: 30 percent weight
- ML Classifier Score: 30 percent weight
- Threshold: 0.65 confidence for detection

## Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters

Located in Code.py:

```python
FIRE_COLOR_THRESHOLD = 0.0018
HSV_LOWER_FIRE = [0, 150, 150]
HSV_UPPER_FIRE = [30, 255, 255]
HSV_LOWER_RED = [160, 150, 150]
HSV_UPPER_RED = [180, 255, 255]
REQUIRED_CONSECUTIVE_FRAMES = 3
FRAME_SIZE = 32
BATCH_SIZE = 32
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.65
```

### Tuning Guide

Lower threshold value for increased sensitivity:
```
threshold_ratio = 0.001  (detects smaller fires)
```

Higher threshold value for reduced false positives:
```
threshold_ratio = 0.005  (fewer false alerts)
```

## Video Processing

### Batch Processing Multiple Videos

```python
import concurrent.futures
from Code import analyze_frame_for_fire

def process_video(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    fire_count = 0
    
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        if analyze_frame_for_fire(frame):
            fire_count += 1
    
    cap.release()
    return {'file': video_path, 'fire_frames': fire_count}

video_files = ['video1.mp4', 'video2.mp4', 'video3.mp4']

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process_video, video_files))

for result in results:
    print(f"{result['file']}: {result['fire_frames']} frames")
```
